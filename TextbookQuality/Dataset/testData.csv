"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) (The Hunger Games),Great Addition to the Series. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins is a captivating and original addition to the Hunger Games series. This prequel takes readers on a journey to understand the origins of the Hunger Games and explores the complex character of Coriolanus Snow, who later becomes President Snow, giving him a lot more nuance than previously afforded. The story delves into the darker and more morally complex aspects of the Hunger Games world, offering a fresh perspective on the events that led to the dystopian society depicted in the original trilogy. While it may not have the same level of action and intensity as the earlier books, it compensates with its rich character development and thought-provoking themes and the lack of 'action' makes sense given the setting and novelty of the Hunger Games at that point."

"How to Catch a Reindeer, Great concept, weird delivery How to catch a mermaid was adorable - this book was weird. It was told from the point of view of the reindeer which was odd. It was doesn’t have a good flow - most rhyming books have some kind of meter - neither my husband nor I could find a way to easily read this book to make it sound compelling - it feels wrong to read a rhyming book without since kind of rhythm. Next time I’ll have to buy a how to catch book in store to check out how it reads before purchasing online."
"Hundred Years' War on Palestine,Was afraid of this…,Michelle I am someone who knew virtually nothing about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so, I went looking for history books to help explain where it started. Israeli books were plentiful and did not pick one side or the other, which was a tremendous help in trying to understand each side’s perspective. Saw this book and I wasn’t sure to expect. There weren’t that many to pick from and as I suspected, it was 300 page rant. By page 7, he’s criticizing all Europeans and I could see regardless of his resume, he couldn’t be trusted as a source for new learners."
